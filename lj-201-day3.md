# Learning Journal day 3  

--  
Day three was another successful day in class. We went through A LOT of stuff, but it was fun. Once again I learned a lot more about Git, this time about creating branches. It was a little confusing at first, but I have the hang of it for now and understand how useful it is! We went over my favorite thing ever for JS...Arrays!..just kidding. Arrays (specifically jagged arrays) gave me a lot of trouble when I was learning Java, but I felt more at ease this time around. I want to practice some nested loops and nested loops involving Arrays.  

I wanted to do some good practice with CSS, but instead I was fixing code for the latest assignment and the previous one, but I have to finish up the rest of my assignments. Hopefully i can practice tomorrow!
