# Learning Journal day 7   

Today i felt went by much better than yesterday after learning how to build constructs. It was a little confusing at first, and it still is to be honest, but once they are built, code looks some much simpler and cleaner. We're halfway through the week now and my brain is about to explode with all of the information ive learned!! It's still fun and engaging, but can be overbearing some times!  

I can't wait to see what I get to learn tomorrow!!
