# Learning Journal day 19  

Today is the last day for working on our projects and I have the biggest sense of relief!!. I've feel like I've accomplished a lot, and I feel like a legit programmer after building a web app from scratch! This has been a VERY good experience this week, these past 4 weeks, and at Code Fellows. I'm extremely looking forward to 301 :D!
