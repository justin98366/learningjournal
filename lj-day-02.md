# Learning Journal day 2  

Today was another successful, productive day at Code Fellows! I am really enjoying the course so far and satisfied with what I'm learning. I was going to Seattle Central and had taken a couple of CS classes before I decided to come here; this is better for me so far. I feel like I'm learning in a way that better suits me.  

I've learned a lot the past couple of day. I've have never experienced the Terminal, Git, and GitHub before today, so learning something complete new has been a lot of fun! I SUCK at CSS because that is completely new to me too, but its fun learning it and fun making a webpage look nice!  

Can't wait until next class!
