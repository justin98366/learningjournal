# Learning Journal day 17  

Today was a another really productive day. My group members and I worked really had and got a lot done. Today I learned a lot working with my peers. I was able to get a better understanding on local storage because we used it in our project. It's still a little bit confusing, but at least i got to practice it more. We also got the most difficult part of our project don't and we are about 95% to MVP, so I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  

All we have left pretty much is to do CSS and then decide if we're going to do the stretch goals that we set for ourselves!
