# Learning Journal day 18  

Today was the most stressful day because it's the day we started CSS, and i suck at CSS! trying to style the webpage the you want it can be daunting. I ran into a few issues about getting things to work especially trying to get what i want lined up next to each other. I was extremely happy when I figured it out!. Tomorrow is the home stretch. My group just has to finish up CSS and do a little rehearsal for our presentation!
