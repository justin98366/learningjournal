# Learning Journal day 13  

Today I pretty much focused on catching up with my work! Fortunately I was able to get caught up enough, then we hit todays assignment. I'm just not grasping Local Storage at all. Hopefully I can get a better explanation during lecture tomorrow or after doing some more reading. Other than that, I'm just pushing through the week!
