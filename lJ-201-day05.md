# Learning Journal day 5  

Today was the end of a really good first week! I learned soooo much its almost unbelievable! Todays exercise was a lot of fun. It was very challenging yet very satisfying when everything was was complete. Not to mention the practice with function and Git and GitHub was extremely valuable.

Now I'm am going to catch up on sleep the weekend and practice, practice, practice! Especially CSS!!!
