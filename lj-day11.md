# Learning Journal day 11  

Day 11 proved to be difficult again. although i made great progress with my code, I am still dot done with the assignment from day 10!! Hopefully i can get done with it tomorrow so i can move on and catch up! Other than that, everything is great. I can't believe we're almost done and project week is upon us!!
