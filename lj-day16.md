# Learning Journal day 16  

Today was a really fun. It is the start of project week which is really exciting. It is a great experience planning everything out for the project top to bottom. I'm doing the yearbook project and I think the concept is really cool!  

We actually got a lot done on the first day and met all of out production goals. It's been really cool working on my team and so far the chemistry is great. We have to work a little bit harder because we are the only group with three members, but so far so good!
